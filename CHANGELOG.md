## [0.3.5] — 2026-05-07

> Two real-world bugs surfaced within hours of v0.3.4 going live, plus a
> defensive pass that closed four more quiet bug surfaces (big-repo
> latency, submodules/worktrees, upgrade UX, write failures). Everything
> ships together as one solid release.

### Fixed

- **`UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows cp950/cp936/cp932 consoles** — `vibe status` (and any other Rich-rendered output) crashed with `UnicodeEncodeError: 'cp950' codec can't encode character '✓'` on Windows CMD, PowerShell 5, and CJK-default Windows installs. The `✓ ⚠ ✗` markers and Unicode box-drawing characters that Rich emits cannot be encoded by legacy code pages. Fixed by reconfiguring `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to UTF-8 at CLI entry — users no longer need to set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` themselves. Reported in production by an external team within hours of the v0.3.4 release.

- **`.vibe/state/.hook.log` showed up untracked in `git status`** — the post-commit hook installed by `vibe init` writes its sync output to `.vibe/state/.hook.log`, but `.vibe/.gitignore` only listed `backups/`. Every commit therefore created an untracked file that lingered in `git status`. Reported by the ProBrain team. Fixed by:
  - Extracting `.gitignore` management into `ensure_internal_gitignore()` helper that idempotently appends missing entries (`backups/`, `state/*.lock`, `state/.hook.log`) without overwriting user additions.
  - `vibe init --force` *and* `vibe start` now run this helper, so existing projects upgrading to v0.3.5 automatically gain coverage for the newly-introduced runtime files — no `--force` re-init required.

- **Post-commit hook now runs in the background** — on big repos `vibe sync --no-refresh` can take several seconds (git log + diff stat over many commits), and the original hook ran it synchronously, so the commit prompt felt frozen. The installed hook now uses the POSIX `(... &)` background-subshell pattern: the commit returns immediately, sync completes asynchronously, and output still streams to `.vibe/state/.hook.log`. Works under git-bash on Windows.

- **Submodules and linked worktrees can now install the hook** — when `.git` is a *file* (gitlink) pointing to `<parent>/.git/modules/<sub>` (submodule) or `<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>` (linked worktree), the previous installer treated it as "no git" and silently skipped hook installation. Added `_resolve_git_dir()` that follows the `gitdir:` pointer and lands the hook in the correct per-checkout hooks directory. Broken gitlinks (target missing) still fail closed as `no_git` rather than raising.

- **`vibe init` no longer crashes on rare write failures** — read-only filesystems, antivirus-locked files, or disk-full conditions used to surface as a Python traceback. Both `install_post_commit_hook()` and `ensure_internal_gitignore()` calls are now wrapped: on `OSError` we print a yellow warning and continue, so init still produces a working `.vibe/` and the user gets actionable feedback instead of a stack trace.

### Hardened

- `ensure_internal_gitignore()` no longer leaves a stray leading newline when the existing `.gitignore` is empty or whitespace-only.

### Tests

- 19 new tests, 249 total passing. `TestCliEncoding` covers the UTF-8 forcing logic with mocked cp950 streams; integration tests verify the `init` wiring for fresh and pre-existing `.gitignore` files; `TestEnsureInternalGitignore` adds 7 unit-level tests covering all helper branches; `TestStartUpgradesGitignore` covers the auto-upgrade path on `vibe start`; `TestHookSubmoduleAndWorktree` covers gitlink resolution and the background-execution shape of the hook script; `TestInitGracefulFailures` covers both wrapped failure paths via mocked `OSError`.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-07

> Closes the cross-session continuity gap: state used to silently fall behind
> git unless you remembered to run `vibe sync`. Now the existing five commands
> carry that load themselves — no new commands.

### Added

- **`vibe status` health dashboard** — surfaces last-sync age, commits behind, per-adapter sync state, and a FRESH/STALE/VERY-STALE classification. Output is i18n-aware (en + zh-TW; auto-selects from `config.vibe.lang`)
- **`vibe start` auto-sync** — pulls new commits since the last cursor before loading state, so a fresh session always reflects current git. No more "I forgot to sync"
- **`vibe sync --note "..."`** — appends a dated semantic note inside the Progress Summary section (recognizes both English `Progress Summary` and zh-TW `進度摘要` headings). Captures the *why* that commit messages alone don't preserve
- **`vibe sync --no-refresh`** — skips adapter rewrites; used by the new git post-commit hook to avoid working-tree noise after each commit
- **`vibe init` installs git post-commit hook by default** — every commit auto-syncs state into `current.md` via `vibe sync --no-refresh`. `--no-hooks` opts out. Hook failures log silently to `.vibe/state/.hook.log` and never block your commit
- **`VIBE_SKIP_HOOK_INSTALL` env var** — honored by `vibe init` so test suites and CI can suppress the hook side-effect
- **`vibe adapt --lang <en|zh-TW>`** — lightweight interface-language switch. Updates `.vibe/config.toml` only; existing state files keep their original language, adapter files don't regenerate. The right tool when you just want to flip `vibe status` between English and Chinese without re-running `init --force`

### Changed

- `perform_git_sync` extracted to `_helpers.py` as a `SyncResult`-returning helper. Both `vibe sync` and `vibe start` now share the same git → state pipeline
- Adapter freshness detection examines all managed files (not just the first), so adapters writing multiple files (e.g. claude → CLAUDE.md + `.claude/rules/*.md` + skills) report fresh as long as any managed file carries the current summary marker

### Fixed

- `vibe init --force` no longer silently reverts a zh-TW project back to English. The new `--lang` resolution is: explicit flag > existing config on `--force` > default `en`
- `vibe sync --no-refresh` no longer prints the C.L.E.A.R. review checklist. The hook redirects sync output to `.vibe/state/.hook.log`; the checklist is for humans, so leaking it into a log file (and hitting cp950 encoding mojibake on Windows along the way) was pure noise
- `vibe sync --no-refresh` silently skips when lifecycle isn't ACTIVE. After `vibe init --force`, lifecycle is READY until the user runs `vibe start`; the post-commit hook used to spam `.hook.log` with "Cannot run 'vibe sync' in READY state" errors on every commit. Plain `vibe sync` (no flag) still errors loudly to preserve the manual UX

### Tests

- 22 new tests, 230 total passing. New `tests/conftest.py` autouse fixture sets `VIBE_SKIP_HOOK_INSTALL=1` so `subprocess.run git commit` inside tests stays deterministic; hook-behavior tests delete the env var in their own scope

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Three-mode adapter output**: `full` (AGENTS.md), `slim` (Claude/Gemini with @import), `compact` (Cursor/Windsurf/Cline/Roo/Copilot — inline standards, no file-read instructions)
- **Cross-tool state sync**: `vibe sync` and `vibe start` inject compressed state summary into ALL adapter config files. Switch tools → AI sees latest progress
- **Claude Code Agent Skills**: 5 slash commands (`/vibe-init` through `/vibe-adapt`) following [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/)
- **Vibe Commands in every adapter**: All tools instructed to execute `vibe` CLI commands in terminal
- **Symlink + NTFS Junction defense**: `_validate_filename` blocks symlink/junction traversal in state directory
- **Advisory lock**: `append_to_state_file` uses cross-platform advisory lock (fcntl/msvcrt) for CI concurrency safety
- **Windows retry**: `_atomic_write` retries on `PermissionError` (antivirus lock scenario)
- **Two-phase migration**: copy all → verify → unlink. Partial failure preserves originals
- **Zero-rules warning**: When legacy files have content but no extractable bullet rules, warn and preserve originals
- **`constants.py`**: Single source of truth for experiment patterns (eliminates lazy imports)
- **`ConfigParseError`**: Core layer raises exception, CLI layer catches and exits (library code no longer calls `SystemExit`)

### Changed

- **VIBE.md eliminated**: Workflow rules merged into AGENTS.md. One less file, one less token hop
- **Bootstrap-not-embed**: Adapter files point to `state/` instead of copying content (Tier 2 compact mode inlines top 10 standards as exception)
- **Summary is pure data**: No "read file X" hints — Tier 2 tools get everything inline, Tier 1 tools use @import
- **Checkpoint marked best-effort**: All docs and adapter output honestly state AI compliance is ~40-60%, git log is ground truth
- **Copilot marked "Summary only"**: README support table shows sync depth per tool
- **Antigravity fallback body**: GEMINI.md includes compact body for Gemini CLI < 1.20.3
- **Skip-if-unchanged**: Adapter writes compare content before writing, avoiding git noise

### Removed

- VIBE.md template, supply chain fingerprint, snapshot system, suspicious instruction detection, dead config fields (`auto_commit`, `auto_detect`, `package_managers`)

### Fixed

- Windows cp950 encoding in git_ops.py
- Heading matching in summary.py now tolerates `###` and extra whitespace
- Code fence detection supports `~~~` syntax
- Lock file race condition (no longer deleted after release)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Smart migration**: `vibe init` detects existing CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules — imports rules into `.vibe/state/standards.md` without overwriting originals
- **User file protection**: adapters skip generating files that already belong to the user (e.g., existing CLAUDE.md)
- **Traditional Chinese documentation**: full zh-TW README and USER-GUIDE

### Fixed

- First-sync `diff_stat` now correctly diffs from root commit (was showing only uncommitted changes)
- Three defensive programming fixes from red team audit (lock safety, config halt, atomic writes)
- Correct cursor adapter output filename (`vibe-standards.mdc`, not `vibe.mdc`)
- AGENTS.md markdown formatting (proper blank lines between headings and lists)
- Standardized `pipx` across all documentation (was inconsistently using `pip`)

### Changed

- README rewritten with clear "what it does / what it tries to do / what it doesn't do" structure
- Documentation reorganized and fully synced between EN and zh-TW
- Internal docs moved to gitignored `docs/internal/`

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **5 CLI commands**: `init`, `start`, `sync`, `status`, `adapt`
- **8 built-in adapters**: AGENTS.md, Claude Code, Antigravity/Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code
- **Strict lifecycle state machine**: UNINIT → READY → ACTIVE → CLOSED, with `init --force` for recovery
- **Smart migration**: detects existing CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .cursorrules — imports rules into .vibe/state/standards.md without overwriting originals
- **Autoresearch integration**: auto-detect experiment commits in git log, record to `state/experiments.md`, configurable patterns
- **i18n**: English and Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) templates
- **Safety mechanisms**:
  - Atomic file writes (temp + os.replace)
  - Exponential backoff file locking (fails safe, never forces entry)
  - Path traversal prevention
  - Adapter snapshot + backup (3 copies) + dry-run default for --remove
  - Input sanitization
  - Frontmatter validation per adapter
  - Config corruption halts execution (no silent defaults)
  - Supply chain fingerprint warning on cloned .vibe/
- **Token efficiency**:
  - Slim mode for adapters when AGENTS.md co-enabled
  - AST-based Markdown compaction (markdown-it-py, respects code fences)
  - Section-aware trimming (never breaks document structure)
  - Skip empty sync blocks (0 commits + 0 diff)
- **VIBE.md Constitution**:
  - Checkpoint Rule with task completion definition
  - Reality-First Principle with force-push caveat
  - Explicit Boundary framework (prohibited actions)
  - Session Start directive in all adapter outputs
- **207 automated tests**, 100% coverage

### Architecture Decisions

- VIBE.md is "Constitution" (behavioral rules, rarely modified), not SSOT
- `state/` directory is the true SSOT (mutable project state)
- `vibe sync` uses pure git append (no LLM dependency, vendor-neutral)
- Adapters derive from `VIBE.md + state/ + config.toml` combined
- CLI modularized into `commands/` subpackage (cmd_init, cmd_start, etc.)
- `markdown-it-py` AST used for section-boundary-aware compaction

### Supported Platforms

- Claude Code CLI + VS Code extension
- Google Antigravity IDE + Gemini CLI
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot (VS Code + GitHub.com)
- Windsurf (Codeium)
- Cline
- Roo Code
- OpenAI Codex CLI (via AGENTS.md)
- Any tool that reads AGENTS.md (Zed, Warp, Aider, Devin, etc.)
